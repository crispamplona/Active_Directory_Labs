# Active_Directory_Labs
In order to get more real world experience, I began with learning about Active Directories and how to set it up within a home environment for practice and testing purposes. I am following a complete in-depth tutorial by John Hammond and hope to be more knowledgeable by the end of his YT series. 

I am beginning this on Febuary 2, 2026 and hope to become more knowledgeable when it comes to managing a network. This README will be an in-depth guide on the process from start to finish. On the main repository will be the more important points of the project.

Download Requirements:
  1. Windows Server 2022 ISO
  2. Windows 11 ISO
  3. VMware Workstation Pro

After installing Workstation, I created 2 VMs (Virtual Machines):
  1. Lab Domain Controller (Acts as the server)
    - Set up password for admin : P@ssword!23
  2. Lab Workstation (Acts as the host)
     - Password : P@ssword2!3
(Saved both as snapshots to enable template copying to create more workstations over time)
